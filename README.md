This dice game is actually a two player game. 

--RULES--
This game starts with player 1 as active player. 
Player 1 rolls the dice and gets a number. 
That number is added to the current score. 
Now the player may hold the game and switch to the second player. 
If the player holds and switch to other player then the current score is added to final score. 

If active player do not hold and get a 1 in the dice roll then all the current score will be lost and player will switch automatically. 
The same condition applies to player 2 as well.
